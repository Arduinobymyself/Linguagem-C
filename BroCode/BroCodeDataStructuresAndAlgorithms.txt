Data structure: a named location that can be used to store 
and organize data.
Exmaple: array
a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

Algorithm: a collection of steps to solve a problem
Example: Baking a pizza
1. heat the oven to 550ÂºF
2. knead the dough
3. add toppings

Another example: Linear search
one by one, examine the elements of an array to find a value.

Why learn DS & A?
1. You'll write code that is both time and memory efficient
2. Commonly asked questions involve DS&A in coding job interviews



stack = LIFO data structure. Last-In First-Out
        stores objects into a sort of "vertical tower"
        push() to add objects to the top
        pop() to remove objects from the top
 
Uses of stacks?
1. undo/redo features in text editors
2. moving back/forward through browser history
3. backtracking algorithms (maze, file directories)
4. calling functions (call stack)
